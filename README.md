## Inspiration

With the spread of the internet and mobility, the digitalization needs of brands are increasing day by day. Most of the brands open their e-commerce platform and make sales on the internet. With the development of Metaverse over time, we think that there will be no brands left that do not open stores in environments like metaverse. Especially in the metaverse environment, where visual perception increases and product inspection opportunities are moved to a different dimension We believe that the pleasure of shopping will be different. The number of vr glasses is increasing day by day and people have started to spend more time in the metaverse. As a shopping experience in the future, we think that the products can be purchased by examining the products in much more detail in the 3D environment, and even an experience similar to the physical shopping experience can be given over time. Instead of buying a land in Metaverse, buying an empty shops in different sizes may be a more beneficial solution for companies. Moreover, in the following stages, each brand will be able to design the store itself with our store designer editor tool.

On this platform, the experience of logging into the system with our own digital twin avatars, trying on different clothes on our avatar and purchasing with EVMOS coin is offered.

In addition, we believe that cryptocurrencies will be used more widely in payments over time and crypto reward mechanisms will become widespread especially in internet shopping. All these are the factors that push us to do this project.
